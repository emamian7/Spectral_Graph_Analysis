#  Spectral Graph analysis
Introduction: Spectral clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that depicts a data set as a graph, and find the best cut to separate the graph into connected components. The first section implemented spectral clustering for unsupervised learning, and the second was to explore the use of multiple kernel learning as applied to spectral clustering.
Results: With the kernels surveyed the best performances achieved an average cluster purity of about 50%.
Future Study:
study could do a wider survey of kernel combinations, add optimizations to the gradient ascent/descent algorithm, and vary more hyperparameters.
